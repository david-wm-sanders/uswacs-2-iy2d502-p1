\subsection{\texttt{Nmap}}
\subsubsection*{Plan}
Use \texttt{nmap} in order to perform a port scan of the server in order to verify that the firewall is operating correctly.

\noindent Run \term{sudo nmap -p- <server\_ip>} to perform a full SYN scan of all ports at the target.

\subsubsection*{Test Results Summary}
As shown in Listing~\ref{lst:test:nmap_results}, all ports other than 22, 80, and 443 are being filtered by the firewall that was configured during server hardening in Section~\ref{sec:hardening:firewall}.
